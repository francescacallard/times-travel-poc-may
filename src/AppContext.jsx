The place you recommend needs to be the place in the country, such as "London" or "Lake Como" etc. The nights needs to be the duration the user has selected plus the word "nights" after. The accommodation needs to be a star rating for accommodation with the words "star accommodation" after, and the priceRange needs to be in 'Â£' with pp after the number.
